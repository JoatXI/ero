# ẹro 
ẹro (translate to “Eye”, in the Urhobo language) is a Python-based screen recording solution designed to automate key aspects of screen capture. Its primary goal is to start and end recording sessions autonomously based on configurable triggers, reducing manual intervention and streamlining the recording process.

## Purpose
The objective of ẹro is to provide a robust screen recording solution that:

- Automatically initiates and terminates recordings.
- Offers flexibility for both manual and autonomous operation.
- Serves as a lightweight and efficient tool for capturing screen activity.
The project is built entirely in Python, making it easy to extend, maintain, and integrate into other Python-based workflows.

## Features
- Autonomous Recording: Automatically start and stop screen recordings based on predetermined triggers.
- Lightweight Architecture: Minimal resource overhead ensuring smooth performance.
- Cross-Platform Support: Designed to work on multiple operating systems (subject to further updates and testing).
